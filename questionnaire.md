# Questionnaire

Please quickly answer the following questions to give us a first impression about the technologies, frameworks and packages you have worked with so far. 

Most of the given technologies are optionally (if not marked otherwise) and even if you do not have prior experience working with them, that's not a problem at all. We think you can learn them in our company very quickly on-the-job :)

## Introduction
For scoring the different technologies, please use the following score:

```
1 : No experience
2 : Fair
3 : Good
4 : Very good
5 : Excellent 
```

Example for scoring your Python skills:
```
Python: 4
Comment: This is a comment, but its optionally and there is no need to answer it.
